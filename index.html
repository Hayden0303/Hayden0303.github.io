                    Ancient Whispers & Mythical Origins
                        - One popular legend claims Confucius invented mahjong around 500 BC, inspired by his love of birds — hence the name “mahjong,” meaning sparrow.
                        - The three dragon tiles (Red, Green, White) are said to represent Confucian virtues: benevolence, sincerity, and filial piety.
                        - While poetic, historians largely dismiss this tale due to lack of evidence before the Taiping era (mid-1800s).
                    
                    From Cards to Tiles: The Real Evolution
                        - Mahjong likely evolved from Madiao, a Chinese card game from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).
                        - Madiao used 40 paper cards with suits and numbers — very similar to modern mahjong tiles.
                        - By the mid-19th century, mahjong emerged as a tile-based game, possibly created by:
                        - Army officers during the Taiping Rebellion
                        - A nobleman in Shanghai
                        - Two brothers in Ningbo

                    Rise in China: Qing Dynasty to Early 20th Century
                        - Mahjong spread rapidly during the Qing Dynasty, becoming a favorite among aristocrats and commoners alike.
                        - Played in tea houses, homes, and social clubs, it became a symbol of leisure and intellect.
                        - Tiles were often made from bone or ivory, adding to its prestige.

                        Global Expansion & Western Adaptation
                        - In the 1920s, American businessman Joseph P. Babcock brought mahjong to the U.S. from Shanghai.
                        - He simplified the rules and published “Mah-Jongg: The Game of a Hundred Intelligences”.
                        - Mahjong became a roaring fad, with themed parties and custom sets sold in department stores.
                        - The game also spread to Japan, where it evolved into Riichi Mahjong, with unique scoring and rules.

                    <p class = "text" id = "text3">
                    From Paper to Bone: Origins of Tile Design
                        - Mahjong began as a card game (Madiao) during the Ming Dynasty, using printed paper cards.
                        - As the game evolved into tiles in the Qing Dynasty, artisans began crafting them from bone, bamboo, and ivory.
                        - These materials allowed for carving and painting, turning each tile into a miniature work of art.
                        - Early designs were inspired by Chinese currency, nature, and Confucian ideals — not just for aesthetics, but to embed meaning into gameplay.

                    Suit Tiles: Symbolism in Everyday Life
                        Characters (萬 / Wàn)
                        - “Wàn” means ten thousand, symbolizing abundance and prosperity.
                        - The calligraphy-style numerals reflect elegance and scholarly tradition.
                        - This suit was likely chosen to represent wealth in large numbers, echoing the value of high-ranking officials and merchants.
                        Bamboo (索 / Suǒ)
                        - Represents strings used to bind ancient coins — a metaphor for connection and resilience.
                        - The 1 Bamboo tile often features a bird (usually a sparrow or peacock), which evolved from early artistic interpretations of coin strings.
                        - Bamboo itself is a symbol of flexibility and strength in Chinese culture.
                        Circles (筒 / Tóng)
                        - Modeled after ancient copper coins with round shapes and square holes.
                        - Symbolizes commerce, luck, and financial success.
                        - The circular motif was chosen to evoke the flow of wealth and the cyclical nature of fortune.

                    Honor Tiles: Winds & Dragons as Cosmic Forces
                        Wind Tiles (東, 南, 西, 北)
                        - Represent the four cardinal directions, aligning with feng shui and Chinese cosmology.
                        - Each direction carries spiritual meaning:
                        - East: beginnings and spring
                        - South: growth and summer
                        - West: decline and autumn
                        - North: endurance and winter
                        Dragon Tiles (中, 發, 白)
                        - Red Dragon (中 / Zhōng): “Center” — symbolizes success, power, and hitting the mark (like passing imperial exams).
                        - Green Dragon (發 / Fā): “Wealth” — tied to growth and prosperity, often linked to the phrase 發財 (fa cai, “get rich”).
                        - White Dragon (白 / Bái): “Purity” — represents clarity, honesty, and freedom from corruption.
                        These tiles were likely chosen to reflect Confucian virtues and imperial symbolism, making the game a reflection of moral and cosmic order.

                    Bonus Tiles: Nature’s Cycle and Cultural Icons
                        - Flowers and Seasons tiles were added later to enhance gameplay and symbolism.
                        - Each flower (Plum, Orchid, Bamboo, Chrysanthemum) corresponds to a Confucian ideal and a season.
                        - These tiles celebrate natural beauty, time, and balance — reinforcing the idea that mahjong is more than a game; it’s a meditation on life.

                    Artistic License & Regional Flair
                        - Tile designs varied by region and artisan:
                        - In 1920s Austria, tiles were inspired by Japanese woodblock prints.
                        - In Germany and France, sets featured reptiles, birds, and even golf themes.
                        - The #1 Bamboo tile became a canvas for creativity — morphing from a coin string into birds, peacocks, and cranes perched on bamboo.
                        This artistic freedom turned mahjong sets into collectible treasures, each telling a unique story.
